# Getting Started
This app--a simple cost-per-use calculator that allows users to enter the name and original cost of an item, then see how the cost-per-use of the item goes down with each use--was built as a side project during the Launch Academy Spring 2017 cohort.

This is a basic React project. It has a Sinatra backend, so
the Sinatra server will be serving your React code up to the browser.

To get this running on your local machine, you'll need to run the following commands:

`npm install`
`bundle install`

Then open up two terminal tabs and run `ruby server.rb` in one and `npm start` in the other.
